  <font size=5>PROJECT <BR><font color=blue> CHARACTERIZATION AND FABRICATION OF HIGH ENTROPY ALLOYS ( AL7075)<BR> through POWERED METALLURGY | January 2024 - June 2024  </font size=5><br> High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) are a class of materials composed of five or more<br> principal elements in roughly equal proportions. These alloys are known for<br> their exceptional strength, wear resistance, and thermal stability, making<br> them ideal for high-performance applications in aerospace, automotive, and<br> defense industries. The focus of this project on AL7075 is due to its inherent<br> strength and suitability for high-stress application.<pre><hr><font size=5>CERTIFICATIONS</font size=5><br> - Automation In Production Systems And Management course complete <br>  from   Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur<br>
